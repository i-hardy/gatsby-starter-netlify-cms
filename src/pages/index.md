description: >-
  I'm Imogen, a web developer based in Brighton, UK. By day I do full-stack Javascript development; by night I dabble in Ruby, Clojure, and pretending I know how to use Twitter. I like to write about coding, learning, and the intersection of software development and ethical philosophy.
